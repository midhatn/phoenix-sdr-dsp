## 1. Purpose

M27 delivers a fused OFDM loopback (TX + on-tile channel + RX) on a single AIE2
core on the AMD Phoenix NPU. The kernel executes the full physical-layer chain
of an 802.11a-style OFDM burst — Gray-labelled QAM-16 payload mapped onto 48
data subcarriers, 4 BPSK pilots inserted at `k ∈ {−21, −7, +7, +21}`, IFFT to
time domain, cyclic-prefix prepending, propagation through a runtime-supplied
4-tap complex FIR channel, CP stripping at RX, forward FFT, least-squares (LS)
channel estimation on the pilot subcarriers, linear interpolation across the 48
data-carrying subcarriers, and per-subcarrier zero-forcing (ZF) equalization
([IEEE 802.11-2020 §17](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.11/7028/);
[van de Beek et al 1997](https://doi.org/10.1109/78.611176);
[Coleri et al 2002](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1035788)).

This is the first OFDM milestone in the M-suite and the first kernel to textually `#include` the M17 FFT source in-file rather than relying on `@iron.jit`'s `ExternalFunction` composition. M17's own wrapper (`tests/m17_radix2_fft/fft64_r4_wrapper.cc`) documents this pattern: `iron.jit`'s `ExternalFunction` (as of `mlir-aie` 1.4.1) does not expose a first-class way to inject preprocessor defines into a kernel source file, so the wrapper defines `FFT_SIZE 64` and textually includes the kernel. M27 does the same and reuses the FFT twice — once as forward for the RX FFT, once as inverse via the conjugate trick `IFFT(X) = conj(FFT(conj(X))) / N` for the TX IFFT.

## 2. Mathematical background

### 2.1 OFDM signal model

Following [Weinstein & Ebert 1971](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOM.1971.1090705) (the paper that first proposed DFT-based OFDM implementation) and [Chang 1966](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6768493) (the parent multicarrier concept), a discrete-time OFDM symbol of `N` subcarriers is

$$
x[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X[k]\, e^{j 2\pi k n / N}, \qquad n = 0, 1, \dots, N-1
$$

which is exactly the inverse DFT of the frequency-domain symbol vector `X[k]`. Reception is the forward DFT `Y[k] = \sum_n y[n] e^{-j 2\pi k n / N}`. On our hardware both directions reuse the M17 forward FFT: the inverse is `x = conj(FFT(conj(X))) / N`, an identity from [Oppenheim & Schafer 3e §8.5](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/discrete-time-signal-processing/P200000003543).

### 2.2 Cyclic prefix

Following [Peled & Ruiz 1980](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1980.1171076), a length-`Ncp` cyclic prefix `x[N-Ncp], x[N-Ncp+1], …, x[N-1]` is prepended to each `x` before transmit. The mathematical purpose is to convert a linear convolution with the channel `h[n]` into a *circular* convolution modulo `N` — provided the channel impulse response satisfies `L_h ≤ Ncp + 1`. Under that condition, the received frequency-domain vector after CP removal is exactly the per-subcarrier product

$$
Y[k] = H[k] \cdot X[k] + W[k], \qquad k = 0, 1, \dots, N-1
$$

where `H[k]` is the DFT of the channel impulse response and `W[k]` is the DFT of the additive noise. Because there is no inter-carrier crosstalk, one-tap-per-subcarrier equalization is optimal in the zero-forcing sense.

### 2.3 Pilot-based LS channel estimation

Following [Coleri et al 2002](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1035788) (comb-type pilot arrangement) and [van de Beek et al 1997](https://doi.org/10.1109/78.611176), the least-squares channel estimate on the pilot subcarriers is

$$
\hat H_p[k_p] = \frac{Y[k_p]}{X_p[k_p]}, \qquad k_p \in \{-21, -7, +7, +21\}
$$

with pilots `X_p[k_p] = ±1` (BPSK). Because pilots are BPSK, the division reduces to a signed pass-through of `Y[k_p]`. Estimates on data subcarriers are obtained by piecewise linear interpolation in `k`:

$$
\hat H_d[k] = \hat H_p[k_a] + (k - k_a) \cdot \frac{\hat H_p[k_b] - \hat H_p[k_a]}{k_b - k_a}
$$

where `(k_a, k_b)` is the pair of adjacent pilots bracketing data subcarrier `k`. For data subcarriers outside the outermost pilots — `k < -21` or `k > +21` — the estimate is extrapolated by using the nearest pair of pilots on the interior side (equivalent to holding the linear-interp slope past the boundary). This is the same policy documented in [Rice 2e Ch 8](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/digital-communications-a-discrete-time-approach/P200000003544).

### 2.4 Zero-forcing equalization

Per-subcarrier ZF is the elementwise divide `X̂[k] = Y[k] / Ĥ_d[k]`. Its noise-enhancement penalty is well-known ([Proakis & Salehi 5e §13.5](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/digital-communications-proakis-salehi/M9780072957167.html)) — subcarriers where `|Ĥ_d[k]|` is small get their noise amplified — but the alternative (MMSE) requires an SNR estimate that we do not have on-tile. ZF is the standard choice for a first OFDM RX implementation and is what [IEEE 802.11a](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.11/7028/) reference receivers implement.

Divide is written in kernel as `(Y * conj(Ĥ)) / |Ĥ|²`. The division-by-magnitude-squared avoids a complex-divide primitive that Peano NOCPP does not vector-lower cleanly.

## 3. 802.11a subcarrier map

Following [IEEE 802.11-2020 §17.3.5](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.11/7028/), the 64-point IDFT input vector `X[k]` uses subcarrier indices `k ∈ {-32, -31, …, -1, 0, +1, …, +31}` with the following per-index assignment:

| Index `k` | Assignment | Count |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `-32` | Guard (zero) | 1 |
| `-31 … -27` | Guard (zero) | 5 |
| `-26 … -22, -20 … -8, -6 … -1` | Data | 24 (of 48) |
| `-21, -7` | Pilot (BPSK) | 2 (of 4) |
| `0` | DC (zero) | 1 |
| `+1 … +6, +8 … +20, +22 … +26` | Data | 24 (of 48) |
| `+7, +21` | Pilot (BPSK) | 2 (of 4) |
| `+27 … +31` | Guard (zero) | 5 |

Total: 48 data + 4 pilot + 11 guard + 1 DC = 64. The IDFT-input buffer uses
native, unshifted FFT order: DC is at index 0, positive frequencies are at
indices `1..31`, and negative frequencies are at indices `32..63` (which
correspond to `k = -32 .. -1`). No `fftshift` layout is used.

Pilot polarity follows the [IEEE 802.11-2020 §17.3.5.10](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.11/7028/) sign convention: `p = (+1, +1, +1, -1)` for pilots at `k ∈ {-21, -7, +7, +21}` on OFDM symbol 0. Higher symbols multiply this vector by a scrambling sequence; for M27's first-bring-up test we hold the pilot pattern constant across all 8 symbols in the burst, which is a valid simplification since we do not exercise frame-level scrambling.

## 4. Fused-kernel architecture

M27 ships as a single `@iron.jit ofdm_loopback` entry on one AIE2 core (compile-time constants: `N_FFT = 64`, `N_CP = 16`, `N_SYM = 8`). The kernel body, from top to bottom:

1. **Pilot / data multiplex.** Load 48 QAM-16 data symbols per OFDM symbol from `in_data`. Insert `±1` pilots at `k ∈ {-21, -7, +7, +21}`. Insert zeros at DC and 11 guard indices. Write to a length-64 complex buffer `X[k]` in natural FFT order.
2. **IFFT via conjugate trick.** Conjugate `X → X*`. Call the M17 forward FFT (`fft_stockham_f32`, textually included at compile time via `#define FFT_SIZE 64` + `#include "../../kernels/fft_stockham_f32.cc"`). Conjugate the output and divide by `N=64` to get `x[n] = IDFT(X)`.
3. **CP-add.** Prepend the last 16 samples of `x[n]` to form `s[n]` of length `N + Ncp = 80`. Concatenate across 8 OFDM symbols to a 640-sample TX stream.
4. **Channel FIR.** Convolve `s[n]` with a compiled-in 4-tap complex FIR whose taps are supplied via a DMA buffer `in_channel` (8 bf16 = 4 complex bf16). Because the channel impulse response is length 4 and the CP is length 16, the linear-to-circular conversion holds.
5. **CP-strip.** Discard the first 16 samples of each 80-sample block, keeping the remaining 64 samples per OFDM symbol.
6. **Forward FFT.** Call `fft_stockham_f32` per OFDM symbol to obtain `Y[k]`.
7. **Pilot LS.** For each of the 4 pilots, compute `Ĥ_p[k_p] = Y[k_p] * X_p[k_p]` (BPSK: `X_p = ±1` so this is a signed pass-through with no real divide).
8. **Linear interpolation.** For each of the 48 data subcarriers, find the bracketing pilot pair (or the nearest edge pair for extrapolation) and compute `Ĥ_d[k]` by linear interpolation in the subcarrier index `k`.
9. **ZF equalization.** For each data subcarrier: `X̂[k] = Y[k] * conj(Ĥ_d[k]) / (Ĥ_d[k].re² + Ĥ_d[k].im²)`.
10. **Emit.** Write 48 equalized complex bf16 slots per OFDM symbol to `out_data`, for a total of 384 equalized data subcarriers across the 8-symbol burst.

Steps 1–3 are the TX side; step 4 is the channel model; steps 5–10 are the RX side. All internal math is `float32`; I/O is `bfloat16`. The kernel uses no shift-registers or state across the outer loop — every OFDM symbol is independent.

### 4.1 Reuse of the M17 FFT

The `#include`-then-call pattern matches M17's own `fft64_r4_wrapper.cc` exactly. Because the M17 kernel file contains its own `extern "C" { void fft_stockham_f32(...) { … } }`, textually including it inside `ofdm_loopback_kernel.cc` produces a per-tile inline instance of `fft_stockham_f32` compiled for `FFT_SIZE 64`. The M27 kernel calls this symbol six times per OFDM burst (2 × 8 = 16 FFTs total: 8 IFFTs on TX, 8 forward FFTs on RX; the 6× / 16× discrepancy in an earlier draft was corrected here).

The FFT kernel is defined once inside the M27 kernel's translation unit.
Program-memory budget check: M17's fused radix-4 Stockham at `N=64` compiles
to ~5 KB program memory ([M17_V3_DESIGN.md](M17_V3_DESIGN.md) §5). Including
it once in M27 gives one copy of the FFT code, not sixteen — the same function
is called sixteen times. This fits inside the AIE2 tile's 16 KB program memory
budget with the additional pilot LS + linear interpolation + ZF equalization
overhead.

## 5. Why gate (c) is assertable (contrast with M25/M26)

M25 and M26 gate (c) had to become diagnostic because the receiver contained two independent closed-loop control systems (Gardner timing integrator + Costas / decision-directed phase integrator). CPU float32-serial and AIE2 float32-SIMD rounding integrate to different steady-state equilibria after ~1/BW_φ symbols, per [NASA JPL TDA Progress Report 42-130](https://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-130/130B.pdf) and [Kuznetsov et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00071). This is a fundamental property of coupled feedback dynamics with different float rounding — no kernel-side fix can restore bit-exact SER.

OFDM RX is **open-loop** given a synchronized frame. There is no timing integrator (frame boundary is known); there is no carrier-tracking integrator (residual CFO is folded into the channel estimate). The whole receiver is a fixed sequence of arithmetic operations: FFT → pilot pass-through → linear interpolation → complex divide. The same input samples produce the same output samples up to bf16 quantization, whether run on CPU or AIE2. Therefore:

- **Gate (a) transliteration** stays asserted — the kernel is deterministic and bit-exact vs the host reference (0/`N` slots differ on ≥2 seeds).
- **Gate (c) is a post-equalizer AWGN sensitivity diagnostic.** The current
  test dispatches the identity-channel loopback once, then adds AWGN to the
  equalized host output before hard slicing. It does not inject Rayleigh fading
  or AWGN before CP removal, FFT, LS estimation, or ZF equalization, and it is
  not evidence of noisy-channel receive-chain validation.

## 6. Test plan

Implemented as `tests/m27_ofdm/test_ofdm_m27.py`. The suite has **4 reference-only tests** plus **4 silicon gates**.

### 6.1 Reference tests (host-only)

- **R1** — 64-pt IDFT-then-DFT round-trip on random QAM-16 constellations matches to bf16 precision.
- **R2** — Pilot LS on a synthetic frequency-flat channel `H[k] = c` returns `Ĥ_p = c` on all 4 pilots to `1e-6` relative error.
- **R3** — Linear interpolation across 48 data subcarriers matches `numpy.interp` on the same knots.
- **R4** — ZF equalization on `Y[k] = H[k] X[k]` with known `H` and `X` recovers `X` exactly.

### 6.2 Silicon gates

- **Gate (a) — transliteration bit-exact.** With deterministic seed 827, kernel output on silicon matches host reference bit-for-bit on all 384 equalized data subcarriers (`0/768 bf16 slots differ`).
- **Gate (b) — EVM ≤ 3% on delay-spread channel.** With channel taps `[1.0, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1] + j·[0.0, 0.1, 0.05, 0.02]` (`L_h = 4 ≤ N_cp + 1 = 17`), no noise, EVM on the 384 equalized data subcarriers ≤ 3%.
- **Gate (c) — post-equalizer AWGN diagnostic.** The test adds host-side AWGN
  at SNR = 20 dB after an identity-channel dispatch, then hard-slices each
  equalized data subcarrier. It is not a channel-estimation or fading-channel
  test.
- **Gate (c-diag) — EVM display only.** The current code prints
  `20 log10(EVM)`, which is negative when EVM is below 100%. The legacy
  positive “≥ 25 dB” wording is sign-inconsistent and is not an acceptance
  criterion.
- **Gate (d) — pilot-only sanity.** Channel taps `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, data slots all zero, pilots `±1`. After LS + linear-interp + ZF, verify the equalized pilot subcarriers return as `±1` to `1e-3` relative error.

## 7. Bring-up incidents

*(To be filled in after silicon PASS on laptop. Anticipated per M25/M26 pattern: Peano NOCPP has no libc `<math.h>` → open-coded Taylor sin/cos + π/2 fold; `-O2` folds union-based `sign_of` into `llvm.copysign` which AIE2 rejects → `volatile uint32_t` OR into `0x3F800000`; `@iron.jit` decorator required on the driver function or `Program.resolve_program()` returns raw MLIR and no compile happens.)*
