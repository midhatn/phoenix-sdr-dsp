# PQC DR0 Phoenix silicon validation — 2026-08-17

## Evidence boundary

This record documents the physical Phoenix validation of the fused DR0 M33
polynomial-product graph. It is a separate validation record and does not add a
DR0 invocation to `run_all_silicon_tests.py` or change the canonical 34-entry
regression accounting.

The supplied evidence was produced on a Windows Phoenix laptop at
**2026-08-17 19:35:37 +03**. The captured terminal log is an evidence artifact;
it is not added to or modified in this source worktree.

## Validated topology and operation

The observed native backend result applies to the fixed one-worker DR0 graph:

```text
host a --fill--> ObjectFIFO m33_dr0_in_a --\
                                                  AIE worker --> ObjectFIFO m33_dr0_out_c --drain--> host c
host b --fill--> ObjectFIFO m33_dr0_in_b --/
```

The graph has exactly two polynomial ingress transfers (`a`, `b`) and one
terminal polynomial egress (`c`). Inside the AIE design invocation it performs
`NTT(a)`, `NTT(b)`, pointwise Montgomery base multiplication, `INTT`, and
device-side canonicalization. No intermediate NTT-domain or base-product value
is drained to the host, and the one host retrieval is the terminal `c` buffer.

The 24 reported vectors comprise four directed vectors and 20 deterministic
random vectors. Their expected values are compared against the package's
independent direct O(n²) negacyclic-convolution oracle.

## Claims supported

This evidence supports only the following claim:

- The fused DR0 M33 polynomial-product graph compiled, dispatched through the
  native `m33-dr0:silicon` backend, and matched its directed and deterministic
  randomized terminal-product reference vectors on the recorded Phoenix laptop.

## Claims not supported

This record does **not** validate or claim:

- Complete ML-DSA or complete FIPS 204 conformance.
- Performance, latency, throughput, power, energy, or speedup measurements.
- Constant-time execution, side-channel resistance, fault-injection resistance,
  or general cryptographic hardening.
- Host, AIE-local, DMA, ObjectFIFO, XRT, or compiled-artifact zeroization.
- Key management, secret-lifetime guarantees, production deployment approval,
  or CMVP validation/certification.
- Addition of DR0 to the canonical `run_all_silicon_tests.py` suite or any
  change to its 34-entry accounting.

## Relationship to other records

The prior M33a primitive validation is recorded separately in
[`M33_SILICON_VALIDATION_20260817.md`](M33_SILICON_VALIDATION_20260817.md).
DR0 uses production-local M33a arithmetic but this 24/24 result is specifically
for the fused terminal-only product graph described in
[`PQC_DR0_DESIGN.md`](PQC_DR0_DESIGN.md). Source and adaptation provenance is
recorded in [`PQC_DR0_PROVENANCE.md`](PQC_DR0_PROVENANCE.md).
